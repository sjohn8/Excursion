# Excursion

In this project, I have created a web page which advertizes a product called "Excursion".
It uses my currnet toolset including HTML, CSS Command Line Interfave, Git, GitHub.
This project is being created for a Codecademy Course.

The web page we'll build advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences,
so we'll use video and landscape imagery to set the scene. A landing page is a vital tool in marketing a
product these days, and the goal will be to entice potential customers into using the product.
